<h3>Advanced Contact Details</h3>
I have coded this plugin in order to add contact details easily. You can easily add the details and upload icons too. This the first version of this plugin, the layout is simple and if users ask for more customizations I will upload new version within weeks. You can even change some colors,width,height,font-size etc from admin panel according to your theme.
The most important feature of this plugin is that you can add more than one contact details on single site. Other plugins are available there but they dont provide this feature.
